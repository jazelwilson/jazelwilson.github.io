     <p id="Places-to-visit"> 1. <em>Belin's Brandenburg Gate</em><br></p>
        
        <img src=https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/10/28/18/51/brandenburger-tor-201939__340.jpg width="500" height="500">
     
    <p class="paragraph"> <strong>This</strong> is Berlin's most significate monument, a former mark of division and war to a symbol of peace and unity between west and east Germany. <br>
      
      This historical landmark has been in the centre of destruction, warfare, and political damage. Always damaged but never destroyed.  </p>
       
    <p id="Places-to-visit">2. <em>The Black Forest</em> </p>
    
        <img src=https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/08/25/19/10/mill-1620440_960_720.jpg width="500" height="500">
        
    <p class="paragraph">     
        <strong>The</strong> biggest nature park in Germany, The Black Forest is something out of a Fairy tale.<br>
        Full of twisted roads, extraordinary views, and overwelming nature, this brreath-taking environment is surely a great way to spend the day. <br>
        The nature park got its name "Black Forest" from the fact that the trees are close to each other and block out the sunlight, causing darkness within the forest. 
    </p>
    
    <p id="Places-to-visit"> 3. <em> Berlin's Museum Island</em></p>
    <p class="paragraph"> <strong>As</strong> its name states, The Museum Island is known for it's 5 museums:
    <ul class="paragraph">
        <li> Pergamon museum 
        <li>Bode-Museum
        <li>Neues Museum (New Museum)
        <li>Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery)
        <li>Altes Museum (Old Museum)
    </ul>
</p>

      <p class="paragraph">
Schinkel built the the first museum (Altes Museum)  to house the royal Antikensammlung. From there the island continued to grow and new museums were built. First started as an exhibition hall, the island has grown and built musuems of extraordinary history. It is also widely known as the home of the Nefertiti bust. <br>
          Each museum displays different things. The Pergamon museum displays ancient archtitecture; the Neues Museum relates to archaeological objects and eygptian culture and history; The Altes Museum, which is the oldest on the island, exhibits Greek and Roman history and exhibitions on its second floor. The Alte Nationalgalerie displays history from the 19th century and lastly; the Bode museum contains famous old paintings. <br>
          This island is worth visiting and will be a life-time experience.
